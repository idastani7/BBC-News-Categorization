# BBC-News-Categorization
In this notebook, I trained a model  which uses embedding technique to categorize BBC news. 
An embedding layer is a type of hidden layer in a neural network. In one sentence, this layer maps input information from a high-dimensional to a lower-dimensional space, allowing the network to learn more about the relationship between inputs and to process the data more efficiently.
